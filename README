NAME
    App::Daemon - Start an Application as a Daemon

SYNOPSIS
         # Program:
       use App::Daemon qw( daemonize );
       daemonize();

         # Then, in the shell:
 
         # start app in background
       $ app start

         # stop app
       $ app stop

         # start app in foreground (for testing)
       $ app -X

         # show if app is currently running
       $ app status

DESCRIPTION
    "App::Daemon" helps running an application as a daemon. Along with the
    common features offered by similar modules on CPAN, it

    *   supports logging with Log4perl: In background mode, it logs to a
        logfile. In foreground mode, log messages go directly to the screen.

    *   detects if another instance is already running and ends itself
        automatically in this case.

    *   shows with the 'status' command if an instance is already running
        and which PID it has.

  Command line options
    -X  Foreground mode. Log messages go to the screen.

    -l logfile
        Logfile to send Log4perl messages to in background mode. Defaults to
        "/tmp/[appname].log".

    -u as_user
        User to run as if started as root. Defaults to 'nobody'.

    -l4p l4p.conf
        Path to Log4perl configuration file.

    -p pidfile
        Where to save the pid of the started process. Defaults to
        "/tmp/[appname].pid".
